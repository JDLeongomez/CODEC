abstract: "Body height is a life-history component. It involves important costs for
  its expression and maintenance, which may originate trade-offs on other costly components
  such as reproduction or immunity. Although previous evidence has supported the idea
  that human height could be a sexually selected trait, the explanatory mechanisms
  that underlie this selection are poorly understood. Despite extensive studies on
  the association between height and attractiveness, the role of immunity in linking
  this relation is scarcely studied, particularly in non-Western populations. Here,
  we tested whether human height is related to health measured by self-perception,
  and relevant nutritional and health anthropometric indicators in three Latin-American
  populations that widely differ in socioeconomic and ecological conditions: two urbanised
  populations from Bogota (Colombia) and Mexico City (Mexico), and one isolated indigenous
  population (Me’Phaa, Mexico). Results showed that self-reported health is best predicted
  by an interaction between height and waist circumference: the presumed benefits
  of being taller are waist-dependent, and affect taller people more than shorter
  individuals. If health and genetic quality cues play an important role in human
  mate-choice, and height and waist interact to signal health, its evolutionary consequences,
  including cognitive and behavioural effects, should be addressed in future research."
