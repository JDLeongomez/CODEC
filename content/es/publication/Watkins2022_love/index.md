abstract: "Feeling and expressing love is at the core of romantic relationships, but
  individuals differ in their proclivity to worry about their relationships and/or
  avoid intimacy. Saying ‘I love you’ signals a commitment to a future with our romantic
  partner. Contrary to gender stereotypes, research in the US demonstrates that men
  are more likely to confess love first. We aimed to replicate this sex difference
  in an online cross-national sample (seven countries, three continents), while testing
  for variation according to attachment style and environment (the national sex ratio).
  Men were more likely to confess love first in a relationship, with preliminary evidence
  that this was more likely when men had more choice (more female biased sex ratio).
  Independent of biological sex, highly avoidant respondents were less happy to hear
  ‘I love you’ than less avoidant respondents, and highly anxious respondents were
  happier to hear ‘I love you’ than less anxious respondents. Our findings suggest
  that prior observations generalize beyond an ethnically homogenous sample, and incorporate
  attachment theory into the study of love confessions. Our research suggests a dissociation
  between initial declarations of love (moderated by biological sex) and emotional
  responses to love confessions, moderated by attachment style but not by biological
  sex. Key words: Close relationships, Sex differences, Speech acts, Sex ratio, Attachment,
  Affectionate communication, Error Management Theory."
