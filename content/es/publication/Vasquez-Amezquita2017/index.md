abstract: 'Visual attention patterns measured with eye-tracking techniques provide
  indirect clues about sexual response. This study aimed to test the category specificity
  of sexual responses to stimuli varying in gender and age by evaluating both early
  and late attention of gynephilic and androphilic men and women. We simultaneously
  presented sexually preferred and nonpreferred stimuli and measured time to first
  fixation and total duration of fixation on four areas of interest: entire body,
  then face, chest, and pelvis. Androphilic women’s early attention patterns were
  nonspecific,whereas gynephilic women and both groups of men showed a category-specific
  pattern for the entire body. In contrast, all groups showed gender-specific patterns
  of late attention for all areas of interest. We also found support for age specificity
  of early and late visual attention in all four groups, with greater attention to
  adult than child stimuli. This study supports the usefulness of a competing stimulus
  eye-tracking paradigm as a method to examine gender specificity in gynephilic women
  and androphilic and gynephilic men, and as a measure of age specificity in gynephilic
  and androphilic men and women.'
