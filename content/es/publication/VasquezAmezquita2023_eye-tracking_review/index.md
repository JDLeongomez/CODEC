abstract: "Visual attention plays a central role in current theories of sexual information
  processing and is key to informing the use of eye-tracking techniques in the study
  of typical sexual preferences and more recently, in the study of atypical preferences
  such as pedophilia (prepubescent children) and hebephilia (pubescent children).
  The aim of this theoretical-empirical review is to connect the concepts of a visual
  attention-based model of sexual arousal processing with eye movements as indicators
  of atypical sexual interests, to substantiate the use of eye-tracking as a useful
  indirect measure of sexual preferences according to sex and age of the stimuli.
  Implications for research are discussed in terms of recognizing the value, scope,
  and limitations of eye-tracking in the study of pedophilia and other chronophilias
  in males and females, and the generation of new hypotheses using this type of indirect
  measure of human sexual response."
