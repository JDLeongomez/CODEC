abstract: How to achieve dominance in a group is a recurrent challenge for individuals
  of many species, including humans. Previous research indicates that both relationship
  status and contraceptive use appear to moderate women’s testosterone levels. If
  testos- terone contributes to dominance, this raises the possibility for group differences
  in dominance between single and partnered women, and between users and non-users
  of hormonal contraception. Here, we examine associations between relationship status
  and use/non-use ofhormonal contraception and women’s self-reported social dominance.
  In a sample of 84 women, we replicate previous research documenting a significant
  positive correlation between women’s saliva testosterone levels and their self-
  reported dominance. Consistent with other literature, we also find that women using
  hormonal contraception have significantly lower testosterone than those who are
  regularly cycling and that partnered women have significantly lower testosterone
  than single women. Although we do not find a main effect of either relationship
  status or hormonal contraceptive use status on women’s reported levels of dominance,
  the interaction between these variables predicted reported dominance scores. This
  interac- tion remained significant when participant age and testosterone values
  were added to the model as covariates. We discuss these results in the context ofthe
  existing literature on testosterone and women’s dominance behaviour and with respect
  to the evolutionary benefits of social dominance in women.
