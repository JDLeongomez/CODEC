abstract: "The human voice carries information about a vocaliser’s physical strength
  that listeners can perceive, and that may influence mate choice and intrasexual
  competition. Yet, reliable acoustic correlates of strength in human speech remain
  unclear. Compared to speech, aggressive nonverbal vocalisations (‘roars’) may function
  to maximise perceived strength, suggesting that their acoustic structure has been
  selected to communicate formidability, similar to the vocal threat displays of other
  animals. Here, we test this prediction in two non-WEIRD African samples: an urban
  community of Cameroonians and rural nomadic Hadza hunter-gatherers in the Tanzanian
  bushlands. Participants produced standardised speech and volitional roars and provided
  handgrip strength measures. Using acoustic analysis and informationtheoretic multi-model
  inference and averaging techniques, we show that strength can be measured from both
  speech and roars, and as predicted, strength is more reliably gauged from roars
  than vowels, words or greetings. The acoustic structure of roars explains 40-70%
  of the variance in actual strength within adults of either sex. However, strength
  is predicted by multiple acoustic parameters whose combinations vary by sex, sample
  and vocal type. Thus, while roars may maximally signal strength, more research is
  needed to uncover consistent and likely interacting acoustic correlates of strength
  in the human voice."
