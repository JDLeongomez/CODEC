abstract: "Sexual selection, including mate choice and intrasexual competition, is
  responsible for the evolution of some of the most elaborated and sexually dimorphic
  traits in animals. Although there is sexual dimorphism in the shape of human faces,
  it is not clear whether this is similarly due to mate choice, or whether mate choice
  affects only part of the facial shape difference between men and women. Here we
  explore these questions by investigating patterns of both facial shape and facial
  preference across a diverse set of human populations. We find evidence that human
  populations vary substantially and unexpectedly in both the magnitude and direction
  of facial sexually dimorphic traits. In particular, European and South American
  populations display larger levels of facial sexual dimorphism than African populations.
  Neither cross-cultural differences in facial shape variation, sex differences in
  body height, nor differing preferences for facial femininity and masculinity across
  countries, explain the observed patterns of facial dimorphism. Altogether, the association
  between sexual shape dimorphism and attractiveness is moderate for women and weak
  (or absent) for men. Analysis that distinguishes between allometric and non-allometric
  components reveals that non-allometric facial dimorphism is preferred in women’s
  faces but not in faces of men. This might be due to different regimes of ongoing
  sexual selection acting on men, such as stronger intersexual selection for body
  height and more intense intrasexual physical competition, compared with women."
