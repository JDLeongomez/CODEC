abstract: "Voice characteristics are important to communicate socially relevant information.
  Recent research has shown that individuals alter their voices depending on the context
  of social interactions and perceived characteristics of the audience, and this affects
  how they are perceived. Numerous studies have also shown that the presence of bodily
  odours can elicit psychological changes in people. Here, we tested whether the presence
  of male axillary odour would influence vocal modulations in courtship contexts.
  We analysed differences in vocal parameters and attractiveness ratings across 950
  recordings from 80 participants as they responded to opposite sex target stimuli.
  Using these, we tested whether men’s and women’s vocal parameters and perceived
  attractiveness differed in the presence or absence of the odour. We expected women
  to speak with increased voice F0, and men to lower their pitch, when exposed to
  male body odour, especially if it were of high quality. However, neither the presence
  of male odour, its quality, nor the addition of androstadienone produced any consistent
  changes in vocal parameters. Nevertheless, rated stimulus attractiveness was predicted
  by F0 and especially F0 variability, suggesting that this is a key parameter in
  signalling attraction during human courtship, and supporting the idea that vocal
  modulations are context-sensitive."
