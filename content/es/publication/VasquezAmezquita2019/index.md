abstract: 'Men, whether gynephilic or androphilic, show both early and late attention
  toward adults and not toward children. We examined early and late visual attention
  to sexually mature versus immature stimuli in four groups of heterosexual men: sexual
  offenders against children (SOAC = 18), sexual offenders against adults (SOAA =
  16), nonsexual offenders (NSO = 18), and nonoffending men (NOM = 19). We simultaneously
  presented adult and child stimuli and measured time to first fixation, number of
  first fixations, total duration of fixation, and fixation count to four areas of
  interest: entire body, then face, chest, and pelvis. We found a significant interaction
  where only SOAC tended to fixate more first times to child than to adult stimuli.
  Conversely, we found longer total duration of fixations for the bodies of adults
  compared to the bodies of children in all groups; however, in both the total duration
  of fixations and the fixation count for the whole body, but especially in the chest,
  SOAC tended to fixate longer and more often on child stimuli than the other two
  groups of offenders, but not longer or more often than NOM. This study adds to the
  limited research using eye-tracking techniques in samples of SOAC.'
