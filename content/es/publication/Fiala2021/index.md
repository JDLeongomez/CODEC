abstract: "Despite intensive research, evolutionary psychology has not yet reached
  a consensus regarding the association between sexual dimorphism and attractiveness.
  This study examines associations between perceived and morphological facial sexual
  dimorphism and perceived attractiveness in samples from five distant countries (Cameroon,
  Colombia, Czechia, Iran, and Turkey). We also examined possible moderating effects
  of skin lightness, averageness, age, body mass, and facial width. Our results suggest
  that in all samples, women’s perceived femininity was positively related to their
  perceived attractiveness. Women found perceived masculinity in men attractive only
  in Czechia and Colombia, two distant populations. The association between perceived
  sexual dimorphism and attractiveness is thus potentially universal only for women.
  Across populations, morphological sexual dimorphism and averageness are not universally
  associated with either perceived facial sexual dimorphism or attractiveness. With
  our exploratory approach, results highlight the need for control of which measure
  of sexual dimorphism is used (perceived or measured) because they affect perceived
  attractiveness differently. Morphological averageness and sexual dimorphism are
  not good predictors of perceived attractiveness. It is noted that future studies
  should use more population samples to allow for identification of specific effects
  of local environmental and socioeconomic conditions on preferred traits in unmanipulated
  local facial stimuli."
