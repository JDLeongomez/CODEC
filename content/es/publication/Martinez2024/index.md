abstract: "In the present research we examine the effect of dehumanizing framing of
  ex-perpetrators of violence on participants’ attributions of their agency, punishment
  deservingness, and suitableness for re-socialization in post-conflict. For this
  purpose, we collected data in the aftermath of a peace agreement between the government
  and the FARC guerrilla in Colombia. In two studies, using within (Study 1) and between
  (Study 2) subjects experimental designs (N = 223), participants read manipulated
  news articles describing the capture of a fictional FARC guerrilla member. They
  were exposed (Study 1) and randomly assigned (Study 2) to a “humanizing frame” condition,
  where the ex-perpetrator was described emphasizing human traits (e.g., his identity,
  affective and mental states), and to a “dehumanizing frame” condition, where these
  traits were omitted, and the ex-perpetrator was generically nominated with terms
  such as terrorist or bandit. Across conditions we measured participants’ attributions
  of perpetrators’ human agency, blame, punishment deservingness, as well as participants’
  re-socialization expectations, and social distance towards the character. Results
  indicate that compared to the humanizing frame condition, in the dehumanizing frame
  condition participants significantly attribute less agency to the perpetrator, endorse
  more severe retributive judgments, show more negative attitudes towards his re-socialization,
  and express greater social distance. We discuss the implications of these findings
  for the Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) process of ex-perpetrators
  in post-conflict societies."
