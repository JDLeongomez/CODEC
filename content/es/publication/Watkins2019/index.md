abstract: Romantic mouth-to-mouth kissing is culturally widespread, although not a
  human universal, and may play a functional role in assessing partner health and
  maintaining long-term pair bonds. Use and appreciation of kissing may therefore
  vary according to whether the environment places a premium on good health and partner
  investment. Here, we test for cultural variation (13 countries from six continents)
  in these behaviours/attitudes according to national health (historical pathogen
  prevalence) and both absolute (GDP) and relative wealth (GINI). Our data reveal
  that kissing is valued more in established relationships than it is valued during
  courtship. Also, consistent with the pair bonding hypothesis of the function of
  romantic kissing, relative poverty (income inequality) predicts frequency of kissing
  across romantic relationships. When aggregated, the predicted relationship between
  income inequality and kissing frequency (r=.67, BCa 95%CI[.32,.89]) was over five
  times the size of the null correlations between income inequality and frequency
  of hugging/cuddling and sex. As social complexity requires monitoring resource competition
  among large groups and predicts kissing prevalence in remote societies, this gesture
  may be important in the maintenance of long-term pair bonds in specific environments.
