abstract: "Studies show that specific vocal modulations, akin to those of infant-directed
  speech and perhaps music, play a role in communicating intentions and mental states
  during human social interaction. Based on this, we propose a model for the evolution
  of musicality –the capacity to process musical information– in relation to human
  vocal communication. We suggest that a complex social environment, with strong social
  bonds, promoted the appearance of musicality-related abilities. These social bonds
  were not limited to those between offspring and mothers or other carers, although
  these may have been especially influential in view of altriciality of human infants.
  The model can be further tested in other species by comparing levels of sociality
  and complexity of vocal communication. By integrating several theories, our model
  presents a radically different view of musicality, not limited to specifically musical
  scenarios, but one in which this capacity originally evolved to aid parent-infant
  communication and bonding, and even today plays a role, not only in music but also
  in infant-directed speech (IDS), as well as some adult-directed speech (ADS) contexts."
