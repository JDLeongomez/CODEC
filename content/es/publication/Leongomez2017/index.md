abstract: "Non-verbal behaviours, including voice characteristics during speech, are
  an important way to communicate social status. Research suggests that individuals
  can obtain high social status through dominance (using force and intimidation) or
  through prestige (by being knowledgeable and skillful). However, little is known
  regarding differences in the vocal behaviour of men and women in response to dominant
  and prestigious individuals. Here, we tested within-subject differences in vocal
  parameters of interviewees during simulated job inter-views with dominant, prestigious,
  and neutral employers (targets), while responding to questions which were classified
  as introductory, personal, and interpersonal. We found that vocal modulations were
  apparent between responses to the neutral and high-status targets, with participants,
  especially those who perceived themselves as low in dominance, increasing fundamental
  frequency (F0) in response to the dominant and prestigious targets relative to the
  neutral target. Self-perceived prestige, however, was less related to contextual
  vocal modulations than self-perceived dominance. Finally, we found that differences
  in the context of the interview questions participants were asked to respond to
  (introductory, personal, interpersonal), also affected their vocal parameters, being
  more prominent in responses to personal and interpersonal questions. Overall, our
  results suggest that people adjust their vocal parameters according to the perceived
  social status of the listener as well as their own self-perceived social status."
