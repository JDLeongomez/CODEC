abstract: The emotion of disgust plays a key role in the behavioral immune system,
  a set of disease-avoidance processes constituting a frontline defense against pathogenic
  threats. In the context of growing research interest in disgust, as well as recognition
  of its role in several psychiatric disorders, there is need for an improved understanding
  of behavioral triggers of disgust and for adequate techniques to both induce disgust
  in experimental settings and to measure individual variability in disgust sensitivity.
  In this study, we sought to address these issues using a multi-stage, bottom-up
  approach that aimed first to determine the most widespread and effective elicitors
  of disgust across several cultures. Based on exploratory factor analysis of these
  triggers, revealing four main components of pathogen-related disgust, we then generated
  a novel visual stimulus set of 20 images depicting scenes of highly salient pathogen
  risk, along with paired control images that are visually comparable but lack the
  disgust trigger. We present a series of validation analyses comparing our new stimulus
  set (the Culpepper Disgust Image Set, C-DIS) with the most commonly used pre-existing
  set, a series of 7 images devised by Curtis et al. (2004). Disgust scores from participants
  who rated the two image sets were positively correlated, indicating cross-test concordance,
  but results also showed that our pathogen-salient images elicited higher levels
  of disgust and our control images elicited lower levels of disgust. These findings
  suggest that the novel image set is a useful and effective tool for use in future
  research, both in terms of priming disgust and for measuring individual differences
  in disgust sensitivity.
