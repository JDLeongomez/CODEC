abstract: Many people experience emotions and visual imagery while listening to music.
  Previous research has identified cross-modal associations between musical and visual
  features as well as cross-cultural links between music and emotion and between music
  and visual imagery. However, few studies have simultaneously investigated cross-cultural
  links between music, visual imagery, and emotion in order to distinguish the role
  of cultural experiences in contrast to more widespread perceptual capabilities.
  In this study, we investigate the relationship between emotional arousal and visual
  density induced by 6 musical excerpts differing in tempo and texture (solo vs group)
  in 72 participants from Japan, Iran, and Canada (24 each). We hypothesize that there
  are cross-culturally consistent relationships between tempo changes and 1) visual
  density associations, and 2) arousal ratings. The aim of this study is to understand
  whether relationships between music, emotion, and visual imagery are cross-culturally
  consistent or culturally specific.
