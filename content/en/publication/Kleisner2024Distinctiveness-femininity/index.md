abstract: 'Studies investigating facial attractiveness in humans have frequently been
  limited to studying the effect of individual morphological factors in isolation
  from other facial shape components in the same population. In this study, we go
  beyond this approach by focusing on multiple components and populations while combining
  geometric morphometrics of 72 standardized frontal facial landmarks and a Bayesian
  statistical framework. We investigate preferences in both sexes for three structural
  components of other sex facial beauty that are traditionally considered indicators
  of biological quality: symmetry, sexual dimorphism, and distinctiveness (i.e., the
  opposite of averageness). Based on a large sample of faces (*n* = 1550) from 10
  populations across the world (Brazil, Cameroon, Czechia, Colombia, India, Namibia,
  Romania, Turkey, UK, and Vietnam), we found that distinctiveness negatively affects
  the perception of attractiveness in both sexes and that this association is stable
  across all studied populations. We corroborated some previous results indicating
  both a positive effect of femininity on male assessment of female facial beauty
  and a null or weak effect of masculinity on female evaluation of male facial attractiveness.
  Facial symmetry had no effect on facial attractiveness. In concert with other recent
  studies, our results support the importance of facial prototypicality but cast doubt
  on the role of symmetry as one of the key constituents of attractiveness in the
  human face.'
