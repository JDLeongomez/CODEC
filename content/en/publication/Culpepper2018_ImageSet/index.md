abstract: The Culpepper Disgust Image Set (C-DIS; Culpepper et al., 2018) consists
  of 20 pathogen-salient and 20 pathogen-free images which can be used to assess disgust
  in experimental settings (through the presentation of the pathogen-salient set of
  images) and to measure individual variability in disgust sensitivity (by viewing
  both the pathogen-salient and pathogen-free images). Developed within the context
  of shedding light on disease-avoidance processes and for the purpose of providing
  a reliable alternative to Curtis, Aunger, & Rabie's (2004) images of disease-salient
  stimuli, measure construction employed a multi-stage, bottom-up item-generation
  process that sought to determine the most widespread and effective elicitors of
  disgust across several cultures (English, Czech, and Spanish speakers). Psychometric
  evaluation of the final version of C-DIS was conducted via online survey with participants
  responding from 19 countries. Findings detailing the measure's factor structure,
  internal consistency, and convergent validity were presented. Demographic characteristics
  of the online sample and decisions made regarding item distinctiveness were discussed
  as possible limiting factors. (PsycTests Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights
