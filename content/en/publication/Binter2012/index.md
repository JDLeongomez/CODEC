abstract: Speakers modulate their voice when talking to infants but we know little
  about subtle variation in acoustic parameters during normal adult speech, and investigation
  is impeded by listeners’ understanding of semantic content. Here we circumvent this
  problem by analysing speech in simulated courtship scenarios and testing responses
  in naïve listeners, across both a Germanic (English) and a Slavic (Czech) language.
  Acoustic analysis revealed striking similarity across the two languages in patterns
  of social context-dependent variability in fundamental frequency (F0) but not in
  other parameters. Both sexes varied F0 most when responding to attractive individuals.
  We then show that speech directed towards these attractive individuals increased
  proceptivity in naïve listeners of either language, even when voices were stripped
  of all acoustic properties except F0 by low-pass filtering, which renders speech
  unintelligible. Our results demonstrate that modulating F0 is a critical parameter
  in human courtship, independently of semantic content.
