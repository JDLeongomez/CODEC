abstract: 'Objectives: Facial averageness and sexual dimorphism are extensively studied
  attractiveness markers, which are viewed as possible indicators of biological quality.
  Both are complex morphological traits and both can be easily assessed from frontal
  and lateral projection of a human face. Interestingly, examination of mutual relations
  between the frontal and lateral dimensions of these markers has so far received
  little attention in published research. Methods: In our cross-cultural study, we
  used geometric morphometric data from male and female faces from Brazil, Cameroon,
  Colombia, and the Czech Republic, and analysed correlations between frontal and
  lateral measurements of averageness and degree of maleness/femaleness, i.e. individual
  variation in features that characterize sexual dimorphism. We also analysed whether
  the association between frontal and lateral measurements differs in men and women.
  Results: In general, our results showed a moderate correlation in sexually dimorphic
  features between lateral and frontal facial configuration in both sexes, while frontal
  and lateral facial averageness was moderately correlated only in women. This pattern
  was less consistent when individual populations were analysed separately. Conclusions:
  Referring to the multiple signalling theory, we propose that especially in women,
  lateral/frontal correlations support a hypothesis of redundancy of information provided
  by the frontal and lateral dimension of a given facial attractiveness marker. The
  absence of a significant correlation in male facial averageness suggests that frontal
  and lateral averageness may convey different information about an individual.'
