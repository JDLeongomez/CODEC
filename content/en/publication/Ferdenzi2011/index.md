abstract: 'There is growing evidence that human second-to-fourth digit ratio (or 2D:4D)
  is related to facial features involved in attractiveness, mediated by in utero hormonal
  effects. The present study extends the investigation to other phenotypic, hormone-related
  determinants of human attractiveness: voice and body odour. Pictures of faces with
  a neutral expression, recordings of voices pronouncing vowels and axillary odour
  samples captured on cotton pads worn for 24 h were provided by 49 adult male donors.
  These stimuli were rated on attractiveness and masculinity scales by two groups
  of 49 and 35 females, approximately half of these in each sample using hormonal
  contraception. Multivariate regression analyses showed that males'' lower (more
  masculine) right 2D:4D and lower right-minus-left 2D:4D (Dr-l) were associated with
  a more attractive (and in some cases more symmetrical), but not more masculine,
  face. However, 2D:4D and Dr-l did not predict voice and body odour masculinity or
  attractiveness. The results were interpreted in terms of differential effects of
  prenatal and circulating testosterone, male facial shape being supposedly more dependent
  on foetal levels (reflected by 2D:4D ratio), whereas body odour and vocal characteristics
  could be more dependent on variation in adult circulating testosterone levels.'
