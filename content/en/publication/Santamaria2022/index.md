abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has imposed wide-spread negative impacts (economically,
  psychologically, neurologically and societally), and has changed daily behaviors
  on a global scale. Such impacts are more significant and pervasive in countries
  with higher levels of inequality and reduced Government capacity and responsiveness,
  such as those in the Global South (e.g., Colombia). Differences in social and moral
  cognitive skills may significantly impact individual attitudes and responses to
  the pandemic. Here, we aimed to assess the extent to which factors associated with
  prosociality (including empathy, theory of mind (ToM), and moral judgments) predicts
  perception of SARS-CoV-2 impacts and responses. Participants (N=413) from Colombia
  answered factors associated with prosociality measures and judgments about SARS-CoV-2
  risk, impact, and acceptance of quarantine guidelines. Results revealed that affective
  empathy (personal distress and empathic concern) and moral tendencies (deontological
  trends) predicted greater acceptance of quarantine but in turn yielded an increased
  perception of risks and individual impacts of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, age (older)
  and gender (female) also increased the risk perception and impact estimation. These
  results underscore the role of prosocial-related predispositions informing individual
  responses to the pandemic and provide an opportunity to exploit this knowledge to
  inform successful interventions favoring behavioral change.
