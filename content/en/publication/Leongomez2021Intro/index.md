abstract: 'Research on within-individual modulation of vocal cues is surprisingly
  scarce outside of human speech. Yet, voice modulation serves diverse functions in
  human and nonhuman nonverbal communication, from dynamically signalling motivation
  and emotion, to exaggerating physical traits such as body size and masculinity,
  to enabling song and musicality. The diversity of anatomical, neural, cognitive,
  and behavioural adaptations necessary for the production and perception of voice
  modulation make it a critical target for research on the origins and functions of
  acoustic communication. This diversity also implicates voice modulation in numerous
  disciplines and technological applications. In this two-part theme issue comprised
  of 21 articles from leading and emerging international researchers, we highlight
  the multidisciplinary nature of the voice sciences. Every article addresses at least
  two, if not several, critical topics: (*i*) Development and mechanisms driving vocal
  control and modulation; (*ii*) Cultural and other environmental factors affecting
  voice modulation; (*iii*) Evolutionary origins and adaptive functions of vocal control
  including cross-species comparisons; (*iv*) Social functions and real-world consequences
  of voice modulation; and (*v*) State-of-the-art in cross-disciplinary methodologies
  and technologies in voice modulation research. With this collection of works, we
  aim to facilitate cross-talk across disciplines to further stimulate the burgeoning
  field of voice modulation.'
